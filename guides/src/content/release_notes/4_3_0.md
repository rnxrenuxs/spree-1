## Overview


## Major/New Features

## Modular API-first architecture

Monolith is gone replaced with a truly headless modular design!

We've completely decoupled Storefront (`spree_frontend`), Admin Panel (`spree_backend`) and extracted transactional Emails into their own gem (`spree_emails`). Thanks to this you can:

   1. Easily replace Storefront and Admin Panel with your own
   2. Use the version of Storefront and Admin you like, so you can update the Spree Core and API without the need to upgrade these two
   3. Easily replace standard transactional emails with Klaviyo, Mailchimp and other 3rd parties
 
We're also making Spree less dependent on the Rails framework, while supporting Rails 5.2, 6.0 and 6.1 on Ruby 2 and 3.

### Pages & Navigation CMS

TBD

### Platform API

New set of fast and modern APIs for application to application integrations based on oAuth 2.0 authentication and permissions.
This API completely replaces API v1 which will be extracted from Spree core in 5.0. Platform API is built on the same 
foundations and technology as [Storefront API](https://api.spreecommerce.org/docs/api-v2/api/docs/v2/storefront/index.yaml) 
that means JSON API format, Swagger (Open API) documentation and oAuth 2.0 authentication.

Platform API is the biggest and most robust API for Spree with the biggest number of API endpoints to cover all features
available in Admin Panel plus more. All API v1 usage in Admin Panel was also replaced with Platform API.

### Advanced Product Filters

We've greatly expanded product filters feature. Now you can:

1. Filter by Properties - you can set which Properties should be filterable and the ones you choose will be visible and supported in the Storefront and API
2. Filter by Option Types - you can set which Oprion Types should be filterable and the ones you choose will be visible and supported in the Storefront and API
3. Filters on Storefront, both Properties and Option Types will be automatically shown only when Products in selected Taxon have these Option Types/Properties attached, same goes for values, we're only displaying values from Products in the given Taxon

This way you can create new custom filters in the Admin UI from Option Types or Properties and the system will do the rest work for you.

  Also this finder class can be repleced by custom one by setting 
  
  ```ruby

    ```
